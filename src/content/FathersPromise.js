          1. Jesus, the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          John the Baptist said two things about Jesus:
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          The next day, he saw Jesus coming to him, and said, "Behold, <Text style={styles.italic}>the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</Text>" (John 1:29)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          "I indeed baptize you in water for repentance, but he who comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. <Text style={styles.italic}>He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and with fire.</Text>" (Matthew 3:11)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          We need to know Jesus in both these ways. If you are saved, you know Jesus as the Lamb of God who has taken your sin away and you will go to heaven when you die, but you also need to know Jesus as the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit.

          2. The Father Promised the Holy Spirit
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection and instructed them to <Text style={styles.italic}>wait for the promise of the Father</Text>. The disciples were already saved, having put their faith in Jesus and believing in His death and resurrection, but the Father had something more for them.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Being assembled together with them, he commanded them, <Text style={styles.red}>"Don’t depart from Jerusalem, <Text style={styles.italic}>but wait for the promise of the Father</Text>, which you heard from me. For John indeed baptized in water, <Text style={styles.italic}>but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit</Text> not many days from now."</Text> (Acts 1:4-5)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Jesus explained further, <Text style={styles.red}>"But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth."</Text> (Acts 1:8)
        </Text>

          3.  It Happened Just As Jesus Said
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all with one accord in one place. Suddenly there came from the sky a sound like the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. Tongues like fire appeared and were distributed to them, and one sat on each of them. <Text style={styles.italic}>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues</Text>, as the Spirit gave them the ability to speak. (Acts 2:1-4)
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          The Lord Jesus <Text style={styles.italic}>baptized</Text> them in the Holy Spirit and as a result they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues. This was new to them, but Jesus had told them, <Text style={styles.red}>“And these signs will accompany those who believe… they will speak with new tongues.”</Text> (Mark 16:17). It is good to know that the first time we hear about the concept of speaking in tongues, it came straight from the mouth of the Lord Jesus.
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.title}>
          4. Laying on of Hands
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Philip preached the Gospel in Samaria. Great miracles took place and many believed in Jesus and were baptized in water (Acts 8:4-25).
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, who, when they had come down, <Text style={styles.italic}>prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit; for as yet he had fallen on none of them</Text>. They had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus. Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. (Acts 8:15-17)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Were the Samaritans saved? Yes, they believed in Jesus and were baptized in water. Had they received the Holy Spirit yet? No, the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen on any of them! How did they receive the Holy Spirit? Peter and John laid hands on them to receive the Holy Spirit. Can you see that it was a separate event from salvation?
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.title}>
          5. Paul Received the Holy Spirit
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Does the example of salvation first and then the baptism in the Holy Spirit repeat in the Book of Acts? Paul gets saved on the road to Damascus when Jesus appears to him. Entering Damascus, he is a very different man from the one who left Jerusalem ready to imprison and kill believers. Three days later the Lord sends an ordinary believer, Ananias, to lay hands on him to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Ananias departed, and entered into the house. <Text style={styles.italic}>Laying his hands on him</Text>, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, has sent me, that you may receive your sight, and <Text style={styles.italic}>be filled with the Holy Spirit</Text>.” (Acts 9:17-19)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Note that although Paul had such a supernatural salvation experience, even hearing the Lord’s voice, he was not yet filled with the Holy Spirit! He only received the baptism in the Holy Spirit three days later when Ananias laid hands on him.
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.title}>
          6. Peter and Cornelius
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>Peter preached the gospel to Cornelius. In Acts 10:43 Peter says, “All the prophets testify about him, that through his name everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins.” At this point Cornelius and his household believe in Jesus and are saved. Verse 44-48 continues:</Text><Text style={styles.text}>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word. They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in other  tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered, “Can anyone forbid these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just like us.” He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.</Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          How did Peter know that Cornelius and his household had received the gift of the Holy Spirit? He knew because he heard them speaking in tongues. To Peter and the believers with him, tongues were the sign of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.

          7. Peter Explains
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          The story continues in Acts 11 where Peter explains to the other apostles what had happened,
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          “I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, ‘John indeed baptized in water, but you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit.’ If then God gave to them the same gift as us, when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?” (Acts 11:16-17)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          In Acts 10 & 11 there are 5 synonyms for the baptism in the Holy Spirit:
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          ▪  the Holy Spirit fell on all (Acts 10:44)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          ▪  the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out (:45)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          ▪  they have received the Holy Spirit (:47)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          ▪  baptized in the Holy Spirit (11:16)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          ▪  God gave them the same gift as he gave us (:17)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          There is one more synonym for the baptism in the Holy Spirit in Acts 2:4:
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          ▪  All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          The gift is the Holy Spirit; tongues are the sign of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.title}>
          8. Receiving Long After Salvation
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Paul went to the city of Ephesus where he found a group of disciples (Acts 19).
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          He asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They said to him, “No, we haven’t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” (Acts 19:2)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Now these people were already saved, for they had believed, but they did not know about receiving the Holy Spirit. Paul’s immediate response was to make sure that they received the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Acts 19:6 When Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke with other tongues and prophesied.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Paul went on to plant a church in Ephesus and the baptism in the Holy Spirit was part of the foundation he laid. He understood the importance of the baptism in the Holy Spirit in every believer’s life. Later on he wrote the Book of Ephesians to these believers.

        <Text style={styles.title}>
          9. About Tongues
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          The idea of speaking in tongues can be a little intimidating, but as we have seen in the Bible, it is the sign of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the gift the Father promised, and the Father gives good gifts (James 1:17). Jesus said that those who believe in him will speak in tongues (Mark 16:17). It is all good, the baptism in  the Holy Spirit and speaking in tongues. Paul is in agreement with Jesus that we should speak in tongues. He was thankful that he spoke in tongues and he warned against forbidding anyone to speak in tongues.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Now I desire to have you all speak with other tongues (1 Corinthians 14:5).
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          I thank my God, I speak with other tongues more than you all. (I Cor 14:18)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          don’t forbid speaking with other tongues. (1 Cor 14:39)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Have you ever prayed and felt that you lacked the words to adequately express yourself? Tongues will lift your prayer life to a new level.
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.title}>
          10. The Purpose of Speaking in Tongues
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Praying in Tongues
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Paul wrote in I Cor 14:2, “For he who speaks in another tongue speaks not to men, but to God; for no one understands; but in the Spirit he speaks mysteries.”
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          When you pray you speak to God. God gave tongues to you and He understands what you are praying. If you do not know what to pray in a particular situation, pray in tongues. You will be praying the mysteries of God into that situation.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Paul also wrote Eph 6:18 ‘praying at all times in the Spirit’
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          To pray in the Spirit is to pray in tongues.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Worshipping the Lord
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          We can also worship the Lord in a new way by singing in tongues.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          1 Cor 14:15 What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also. I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          All of us feel low at times and need encouragement in the Lord. When we speak in tongues, we edify or strengthen ourselves in the Lord. Paul wrote in
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          1 Cor 14:4 He who speaks in another tongue edifies himself
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.title}>
          11. What About an Interpretation?
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          When you pray in tongues, you are speaking to God. He gave tongues to you and  He understands what you are saying. No interpretation is necessary. The whole church can also pray together in tongues, just as we can pray together in English, but tongues can also be used to bring a prophetic message to the church. Then it needs to be followed by an interpretation. In I Cor 14 Paul writes within the context of a church meeting,
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          ‘Now I desire to have you all speak with other tongues, but rather that you would prophesy. For he is greater who prophesies than he who speaks with other tongues, unless he interprets, that the assembly may be built up (14:5). So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts, seek that you may abound to the building up of the assembly. Therefore let him who speaks in another tongue pray that he may interpret (14:12-13).
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Again, this is when you address a group of believers, but you may still pray in tongues and no interpretation is necessary, because God understands.
        </Text>

          12. Receive Today
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          The Father’s promise of the Holy Spirit is for us today!
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Peter said to them, “Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Je sus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.” (Acts 2:38)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Ask the Father. Jesus said,
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?” (Luke 11:13)
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Receive by faith. Paul writes,
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          I just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? (Gal 3:2)
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.title}>
          13. Pray this Prayer
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          If you have accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior, ask for the baptism in the Holy Spirit by praying this  prayer:
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Father, I come to you in the Name of Jesus. I thank you for the promised gift of the Holy Spirit.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Lord Jesus, baptize me now with the Holy Spirit and with fire.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Holy Spirit, I receive you now. Fill me with your Person and with your power and enable me to speak in tongues.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          And I renounce any reliance on any wrong spirits or any wrong doctrine and any false god or idol in the Name of Jesus. Amen.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Lift your hands in a prayerful attitude as someone who is baptized in the Holy Spirit lays hands on you. Receive by faith, expect to speak in tongues.
        </Text>

        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Read 14 before praying.
        </Text>


        <Text style={styles.title}>
          14. Start Speaking...
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          The Bible says, ‘They spoke in tongues.’ (Acts 19:6). The abiblty to speak in tongues is supernatural, but you still have to speak. As hands are laid upon you, the Holy Spirit will put strange sounds in you. In faith, start moving your lips to say these sounds. At first it may sound like babble or groanings, but as you continue the words will become more distinct. Some people receive only a few words, while others gush forth in a flow of utterance. That’s okay. As you use your prayer language, more words will come.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          The baptism in  the Holy Spirit brings supernatural power. Jesus said,
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          “But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. You will be witnesses to me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the uttermost parts of the earth.” (Acts 1:8).
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          You will have more power to be a witness, even to lay hands on the sick for healing. The ability to prophesy, greater depth in worship and a deeper understanding of the Word also come in the baptism with the Holy Spirit.
        </Text>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          The Baptism with the Holy Spirit will affect your whole spiritual life in a profound way.  You receive power and you will be much stronger in the Spirit.
